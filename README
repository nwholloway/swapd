This is a program that I'm not convinced of the utility of, but
occasionally there are calls for such a tool.  But, despite that, here
it is...

Swapd will allow free space in the filesystem to be used as swap when
needed by adding additional swap files as needed.

Swapd periodically monitors the amount of free swap available in
the system.  It tries to maintain the amount of swap using upper and
lower limits.  If the amount of free swap falls below the lower limit,
it will add an extra swapfile.  A swap file will be removed if it will
still leave the system with at least the upper limit available.

Since swapping from a file is less efficient than swapping from a
partition, this can be used to `top up' the swap when needed (but will
also work as the sole source of swap).

The original code was written in April 1993, and has been sitting on my
disk awaiting the extra code needed (more parameters, signal handling,
and checking of parameters).  It was actually started when I discovered
that I had failed to compile xv due to being short of 1M of swap (after
having 8+8Mb VM).

All of the parameters can either be changed at compile time, or at
run time from the command line.  The current defaults are arbitary --
if you find better settings, let me know.

Following the same discussion coming up again, some comments were added
to the code and the manual page updated.
